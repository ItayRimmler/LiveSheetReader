This is /data/data_collector.py's description:

After realising I must work with ML, I decided I want supervised learning. So, I need to collect data: I need to play
notes on a piano, record it, save something like 10 peaks, which note each peak corresponds to, and  the actual notes
that were played.
# TODO: How will I do that? How will I match a harmony to a note? And how will I know which one was played, which one was a fundamental etc... I think I need to plan this on paper.

I'll do so with attempts of playing only one note, and thus the peaks will only be the note itself and its harmonies,
and attempts of playing two notes, and thus the peaks will combine two fundamentals, and two sets of harmonies.

I should also include info about duration, sr, and try to alter these parameters.
