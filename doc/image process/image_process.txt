This is /src/app/image_process/image_process.py's description:

This file is sort of the "main of the image process portion of the code". What will happen is several functions will
receive some input, and will output things... And we need to make sure these processes happen in the correct order. So
we'll probably just execute these functions inside one big function called audio_process, and we'll implement it in
main.py.
In the time of making this txt file, everything is still kind of vague and incomplete. So I might change how things are
implemented with time. This is a temporary setup I will work with.

I currently want to create fictional chains, and see how will the workflow look like.
