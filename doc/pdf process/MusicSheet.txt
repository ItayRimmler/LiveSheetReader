This is /src/lib/all/MusicSheet.py's description:

The MusicSheet class is basically a comfortable way for us to load a pdf file that contains multiple pages of a music
sheet.

This object has a list property called "pages", that contains each and every page from the pdf file, and a current_page
property, which indicates the index of the current page we're using.
