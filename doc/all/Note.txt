This is /src/lib/all/Note.py's description:

The .py file contains the Note class. It has type ("Do", "Re" etc.), index within the page, grp (group) within the page
(every 5 staves is a group) and ngrp (number of groups) within a page.

I also added it the matched (med) property. We don't want to match the same note twice. And in the audio_process, we
don't want to add the score of med notes.
