This is /src/lib/chain_process/SubSeries.py's description:

Umm... I'm not entirely sure that this class is necessary, but I kept it anyway. It helps me with the match method in
the Chain class. It's basically like a Chain, but with less properties and methods. I think the only note-worthy to
mention difference is that .val here is a list and not a np.array. But other than that, just look at the doc of Chain
at /doc/chain process/Chain.txt to learn more about the SubSeries.
