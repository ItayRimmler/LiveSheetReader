When we score a chain, we shall do so in a naive fashion, initially. For each good feature, we will grant a point.
Later, we shall adjust it to make the app work optimally.

And to make things simple: Let the group number of a note be n, then: score from group number = e^(last group num - n)
Score table v.1:
    Group number's score = e^(last group num - group num) pts.
    Number of notes in the chain's score = number of notes in the chain pts.

Let's adjust that a bit, because I haven't considered some factors.
Score table v.2:
    Group number's score = e^(last group num - group num) pts. added.
    Let 'a' be an array of cont. subsets (e.g. chain = [1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9] then a = [1, 1, 3, 1]). Then:
        mean of a * maximum value of a  / 2 is multiplied by how many cont. points we have.
